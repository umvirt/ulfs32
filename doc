UmVirt LFS x86 (32bit)
======================

Pros: 
- Lower memory consumption against x86 (64bit)
- Old pc 32 apps support
- Windows 32 apps support (wine)

Cons:
- no 64 bit apps
- 4GB ram max 

Compilation
-----------

Crosscompiled in forge (primary, pure x86_64 bit, without multilib).

There are compilation problems which not appear during forge compilation
because forge has newer version of packages than compilation environment where it was compiled.

One of this problems is lack of glibc support in: 
* m4
* diffutils
* gzip
* findutils
* make

Not all fixes in patches. Diffutils need manual bugfixing 

Binutils opcodes bug when building grub

Libffi updated to i686.


Parameters:

Target: i686-ulfs-linux-gnu
CrossCompiler Dir: /cross-tools32 (/cross-tools in CLFS)
Compiler Dir: /tools32 (/tools in CLFS)

Note: Another directory names used in order to allow multiple cross-compilations
